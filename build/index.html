        This might well be a long and winding title, so we'd better provide for
        some space.
      </h1>

      <p>
        i have, for the better part of two decades, held back from publishing to
        the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        writing stuff down in general has always presented a challenge to me -
        the reasons are varied, mundane and boring. however, the benefits from
        documenting thoughts had and lessons learned have always been apparent -
        to keep me from forgetting and relearning everything every 18 months
        could be motivation enough. i'm also doing it to get more hands-one
        technically, and to have some public opinions for others to critize.
        that last one is part of an ambition to grow as a person. being
        confrontation-averse and unhappy when wrong is holding me back. if you
        find this a long-winded and pretentious way to say "hello world", this
        blog is unfortunately going to annoy the hell out of you.
      </p>
      <h2>on content</h2>
      <p>
        this is of course the difficult bit.
        i have dabbled in several fields over the course of one-and-a-half
        careers, scratching many surfaces, rarely deep-diving and often into the
        nichiest of niches. i often live on the interface between disciplines,
        waving wistfully over to the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        there is value in that though - i make it my job to preserve an outside
        perspective, even while trying to obsessively master my field of
        software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        there are a number of blogs and publications that i find inspiring, and
        i'm planning to link to those somewhere on this site, like a 90ies
        link-collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        i'm still thinking about how to structure the actual articles i might
        write - not having written a lot yet i'm unsure about a format and mode
        of categorization that will both help me to keep motivated and still be
        interesting for readers.
      </p>
      <p>
        i'm very sorry if this intro feels a little old-school - it's the actual
        style i'll be starting out with. being edgy and elegant is more of a
        long-term goal of this endeavour.
