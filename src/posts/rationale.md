# why blog?
i have, for the better part of two decades, held back from publishing to the web.

writing stuff down in general has always presented a challenge to me - the reasons are varied, mundane and boring.
however, the benefits from documenting thoughts had and lessons learned have always been apparent - to keep me from forgetting and relearning everything every 18 months could be motivation enough. i'm also doing it to get more hands-one technically, and to have some public opinions for others to critize. that last one is part of an ambition to grow as a person. being confrontation-averse and unhappy when wrong is holding me back.
if you find this a long-winded and pretentious way to say "hello world", this blog is unfortunately going to annoy the hell out of you.

## on content
this is of course the difficult bit.

i have dabbled in several fields over the course of one-and-a-half careers, scratching many surfaces, rarely deep-diving and often into the nichiest of niches. i often live on the interface between disciplines, waving wistfully over to the other side.

there is value in that though - i make it my job to preserve an outside perspective, even while trying to obsessively master my field of software engineering. 

there are a number of blogs and publications that i find inspiring, and i'm planning to link to those somewhere on this site, like a 90ies link-collection.

i'm still thinking about how to structure the actual articles i might write - not having written a lot yet i'm unsure about a format and mode of categorization that will both help me to keep motivated and still be interesting for readers.

i'm very sorry if this intro feels a little old-school - it's the actual style i'll be starting out with. being edgy and elegant is more of a long-term goal of this endeavour.
